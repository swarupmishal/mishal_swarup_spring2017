He voted, instead, for Hillary Clinton, and here's why: he'd watched that video online -you know, the one starring celebrities like will.i.am, Scarlett Johansson and Herbie Hancock-and he thought it made Obama look Hollywood smug, as if supporting him were this year's version of wearing an AIDS ribbon on your lapel. My friend didn't want anything to do with the latest chic cause, and he just couldn't bring himself to pull the lever for the guy who now symbolized the things he liked least about Democratic politics, starting with all those stars who think they know more about America than the people who live in it.\n",

The family split up on Saturday night, with Mrs. Obama and a friend slipping into ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,'' then congratulating the cast onstage after the curtain went down. A producer, Jeffrey Richards, said Mrs. Obama thanked Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and the other actors for ''blessing my soul'' and added that seeing a production of ''Porgy and Bess'' had been on her ''bucket list.'' Her daughters attended the more family-friendly musical ''Sister Act'' that night, then went backstage to meet the show's 26-year-old star, Raven-Symoné, according to a production spokesman. On Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Obama and her daughters saw ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.'' A bomb scare, believed to be unrelated to the Obamas' visit, led to the questioning of a theatergoer and a search of his bags by the police and Secret Service agents, a spokesman for the production said; nothing suspicious was found. Mrs. Obama had the prime aisle seat often accorded to celebrities because Spider-Man lands a few feet away during the show; on Sunday Spider-Man (played by Christopher Tierney) dropped down and saluted Mrs. Obama, who laughed and waved, the production spokesman said. Of the three Obama picks, ''Spider-Man'' scored highest at the box office last week, grossing $1.74 million; ''Sister Act'' took in $738,916 and ''Porgy and Bess'' grossed $550,485.

      "WHEN we think of the major threats to our national security, the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature, not humans -- an avian flu pandemic. An outbreak could cause millions of deaths, destabilize Southeast Asia (its likely place of origin), and threaten the security of governments around the world. Earlier this year, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the possibility of avian flu spreading from Southeast Asia ''a very ominous situation for the globe.'' A killer flu could spread around the world in days, crippling economies in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. From a public health standpoint, Dr. Gerberding said, an avian flu outbreak is ''the most important threat that we are facing right now.''\n",

      "THE clients, who had just bought an apartment in Trump Tower, asked their designer, Allen Minars, to do something that was, perhaps, a little different; maybe something with some color. In retrospect, looking around their elegant but startling living room, they admit they hadn't really known exactly what the result would be. Mr. Minars took his clients at their word, and rather than shopping in showrooms for predictable pieces, he decided to buy art furniture. The resulting apartment summarizes one of the latest and strongest trends in New York design, 1986: the chairs, tables, desks, cabinets and lights are all designed by artists as one-of-a-kind, signed pieces, with strident colors, odd shapes and angular profiles. Despite their individuality, they add up to a coherent look and a strong statement.\n",

      "Several months ago, a Spanish diplomat involved in organizing the East-West conference here on human rights and cooperation in Europe argued that the 35-nation gathering would be a useful barometer of a stormy international situation. With the conference nearly wrecked by a procedural dispute last week, the forecast seems to point toward a chill in East-West relations, not surprising, perhaps, with Soviet troops camped in Afghanistan and a new, determined Republican administration about to take over in Washington. But the Madrid meeting, to date, has confounded other predictions. One was that the United States, sounding shrill and self-righteous on human rights and Afghanistan, would alienate its Western European allies, more concerned about salvaging concrete elements of the five-year-old Helsinki accords that are under review here. The Soviet Union would exploit this breach, according to the forecast, sowing further dissension in the Atlantic alliance.\n",
