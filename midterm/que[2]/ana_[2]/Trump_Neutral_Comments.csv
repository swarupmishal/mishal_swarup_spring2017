"I said it before and I'll say it again, we need standards for people who wish to participate in Congress and effect laws that not only impact human beings and life in general in this country as well as globally, but impact them for generations to come.<br/>Just as law makers wouldn't tolerate colleagues who aren't toilet trained or are unable to find their home state on a map, they also should not tolerate those who apparently couldn't manage to pass basic high school math and science. Unfortunately, such seems to be the case for a majority of the Republican law makers.<br/>Interestingly, this willful ignorance puts them at odds with their conservative constituents. According to a poll conducted by ClearPath, conservatives DO favor taking measures against global warming. Take a look at the site below where you will find the link to a PDF with very precise questions on how Republican voters feel about global warming and what to do about it.

"Sayeeshwar.......climate change is already happening.  And if you don't believe climatologists, maybe you should know it is already a given to horticulturists, foresters, botanists, zoologists, geologists, oceanographers, biologists, etc......who factor it into research on planetary life.  They aren't all political about it, and they don't all depend on government funding.  Climate change is just the scientifically accepted model.  Really, the only ""skeptics"" left are industrialists, politicians and their followers, and you don't think they have more of an agenda?"
"You won't get to McCain without saying he has let down his father,"
"Been to Russia twice, Urko.<br/><br/>It's one of the best propaganda-based, manipulative dictatorships on the planet with rigged elections as the soup du jour.<br/><br/>Comey rigged the election very nicely for the tyrannical American right-wing.<br/><br/>Putin must be very proud."
"No.  The probably thought they won, and, come to think about it, so do I.  In fact, didn't Trump say that he never settles?  Oh yeah, he never lies, either."
"""Trump Reassures the Media (For Now)""<br/><br/>The media may be reassured.  I'm not.  Not even ""for now""."
Already donated. Hope they are going to bring in cybersecurity experts to look at the Diebold voting machines to see if they were hacked.

"Trump enjoys adulation and attention far more than he cares about the truth.   In his too vivid imagination, it's impossible, literally impossible that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.   And to lose to a 'woman', it's unthinkable in his universe.<br/><br/>Meanwhile his minions spin tall tales, like Bill O' Reilly tonight issuing the proclamation that it could have happened just this way, that Bill's research team - one of the finest! - went to California and found out just how easy it is easy for 'illegals' to become registered and to vote.   It was easy to imagine Bill with his imaginary Ben Franklin glasses, peering deeply into the faces of his television audience.   The lie must be kept alive!<br/><br/>Meanwhile on planet earth, our president elect has been unremittingly the butt of more jokes than likely any president elect in American history, not only here but around the world.   <br/><br/>We await a deluge of Pinocchio cartoons, interposed with The Donald's face.   With his massively inflated egoistic head, now barely able to pass through normal doorways, Don will have to go into rooms now always face first, as his nose will preclude him from entering any other way."

"Correction: ""Sago"" mine disaster. "
That made me laugh. Thank you!
