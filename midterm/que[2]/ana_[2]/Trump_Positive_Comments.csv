"Participation In a democracy does not have any knowledge/education requirement, and certainly once elected, you are equal among all other elected representatives, So, you don't need to satisfy any of the other lawmakers minimum standards, or expectations.<br/><br/>Democracy is the people electing one among them. That was the idea at least. What we have is a whole different can of worms."

The views you attribute to Bernie are pure fiction.  His vision of capitalism is mainstream in many of the advanced nations and was the norm here before Saint Ronald came along and began tampering with the social contract. 
I am encouraging the US to build better rail service and upgrade existing lines. High speed rail would also be nice. I would like to see something like the French TGV I the US. 
"""hold him accountable for adhering to the best of what America is""<br/><br/>How can Trump - or anyone else, for that matter - be held ""accountable for adhering to the best of what America is"" is something that he's _not_ doing "
"Thomas Zaslavsky, 16 Nov post<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Zaslavsky, <br/><br/>Time is what we need, to develop and deploy new technologies for energy production and to better assess the impacts of the changes we are experiencing now. <br/><br/>If CO2 indeed controls the climate, then the news that the acceleration of its growth rate in the atmosphere has stopped, and plateaued at the relatively modest rate of 2 ppm/year, should be greated with joy for all who cherish Earth as humanity's cradle. <br/><br/>This slowing of the acceleration to a relatively low linear rate means that the worst case scenarios projected for global warming will be avoided in the policy-relevant future. <br/><br/>I think that's good news.<br/><br/>What do you think?

"If DT picks Romney or indeed any other rational 'never Trump' Repub, for a spot in the administration, and they accept, they're exhibiting a great degree of self-sacrifice, in order to try to keep the ship of state on an even keel. We need all sane hands on deck. "
"Perhaps Romney would accept the appointment for the good of our country, hoping he can inject a modicum of intelligent sanity into the administration?"

"It's a bit more like the crude oil train that stopped for the night above Lac-Mégantic, Québec.  The brakes didn't quite work and the train began to move very slowly, then a bit faster.  It eventually rolled, pretty fast, into town, setting it on fire.  Climate change hasn't ""already"" happened.  We're merely at the start of a long, nasty runaway situation.  The more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, the longer and faster change will continue.  "
"At first I thought this writer was going to deliver a back handed compliment to Romney and a sarcastic denunciation of Giuliani. Little did I know they were actually serious. According to this writer, Romney is to be disqualified simply because of his pre-election disapproval, ""laced with venom"" of Mr. Trump. By this measure there are approximately three people who could be in the general cabinet pool and none of them are Rodolfo Giuliani. One advantage of Romney is that he is a proven negotiator. He is essentially a self made man through his wheeler-dealer days at Bain. No such negotiating experience for Rodolfo. His style has always been the ""my way or the highway"" approach. Romney' skills might best be used in reforming so called Obamacare. If they are really to do the honest thing, they'll say they've done a root and branch overhaul when in reality they simply change the name to Romney-Care. Rodolfo would best if he were put in charge of developing a national policy on the mentally ill who roam our streets. His first hand knowledge of this problem. Anywhere but State would be an improvement. Imagine his first speech to the UN if it resembled his RNC Convention speech at all. He could handle planning the first Putin love fest but not much more."
"We will all become the social-engineering playthings of a few plutocrats, just like all these thousands of poor students in Detroit, whose lives were destroyed by Betsy DeVos's disastrous charter school experimentations.  <br/><br/>But let's look at the bright side: it will all make for darling cocktail chatter, as Betsy and her ilk gather to think about how to experiment next with the little people, reveling in the vainglorious certainty that obscene inherited wealth produces valuable ideas and useful expertise in addressing complex public policy issues. "
