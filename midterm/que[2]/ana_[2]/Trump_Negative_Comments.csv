"No one appears to be immune from the problem but those with graduate degrees in the sciences seem to be less affected than others. A four year college degree doesn’t seem to provide that much 'immunization' as engineers are often the 'creation scientists', and some other degrees don’t appear to provide the ability to readily discern fact from fiction.  <br/><br/>Don't forget that about a quarter of Democrat believe in creationism, as do about a quarter of people with college degrees. Democrats are much more likely to want to shut down nuclear power in site of the fact that it has actually saved millions of lives due to less coal being burned. Democrats have pushed for assault weapon bans in spite of the fact that it would have an unmeasurable impact on the national homicide rate, and worse yet while ignoring the primary contributors to firearm homicides in the country.  When values and beliefs are embraced one is at risk as they tend to change slowly, if at all. "
"The common denominator among Trump's appointments and inner circle is the sycophantic badge of honor they all hold for following him to the depths of human decency for the sake of enhancing their own careers. Brushing aside his ignorant proclamations, misogynistic outbursts and racist rants. And now, Mitt Romney who warned in March that to chose Trump for President ""the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished"", comes in search of an appointment. Is there no level they will not stoop to?<br/>What an unseemly spectacle!"
"At least Romney is a grownup, though.  At least there will be one flawed but not horribly awful person in their midst."

"This is absurd. Is the NYT setting its readers up for a shift towards pleasing Trump and his administration? The NYT did not even vet Trump. It ignored the corruption of his foundation and stayed away from reporting in earnest his tangled business dealings and numerous lawsuits that pose more of an ethical threat than the Clinton Foundation ever could have. But only now is Donald being vetted somewhat but after the fact. We heard more about emails than anything else. And that did as much to suppress Clinton's vote as did Comey and the Russians.  I hear a lot of Trump voters who claim that America has become too soft, too much PC and that they are sick of hearing about safe spaces. So why then are they complaining the loudest when Trump Is bashed and criticized? Not all Trump voters are racist BUT all Trump voters knew that he is. So please, NYT, spare me your coddling of the Trump voter. That's not your job."
"Trump's populism is not dependent upon economics, economic class, or policy positions.<br/><br/>This election demonstrated that the Republican base is indifferent to sexual scandals, financial chicanery, and overt expressions of racism by their candidates.  Forget about the shallow pretensions of the 'Moral Majority' of yesteryear - Trump has demolished the last remnants of that facade. <br/><br/>The Republican base voted for an Attitude, with little expectation of any actual results from their candidate. Rhetoric is more important than results. That attitude is a snarling, free-floating cynicism that borders on outright nihilism that has become the core of their identity as Americans. <br/><br/>The Confederacy thrives on rejecting the Union, or the 'establishment' in today's terminology. The Civil War continues, and to no good or meaningful end. "

"""With Trump the plutocracy has taken over Washington""<br/><br/>Hillary was not plutocracy? What was Trump running against, Bernie? It was the plutocratic status quo that has looted this country for themselves, and all their wars and twisted economics.<br/><br/>In most places across this whole country, enough people disliked Hillary so much they'd vote for even Trump just to reject her."
"Disbelieving and still suffering from PTSD-type symptoms hearing Trump had become the ""president-elect"". Then I started to do some research and discovered that 29 million Americans vote on antiquated and insecure voting machines. Two nationally-renown and credible computer experts write:  “We know that the national results could be tipped by manipulating the vote count in a relatively small number of jurisdictions — a few dozen spread across a few key states. We know that the vast majority of local elections officials have limited resources to detect or defend against cyber attacks. And while pre-election polls have large uncertainties, they were consistently off. And various aspects of the preliminary results, such as a high rate of undervotes for president, have aroused suspicion.

I believe it is missing the point to suggest that Trump's problem is vanity and ego.<br/>I believe something much more sinister is at play inside of his problematic personality. What that sinister aspect consists of remains to be uncovered. 
"Tim,<br/><br/>You said, "" ... Don will have to go into rooms now always face first ...""<br/><br/>And that will cause even more problems because he will have to pause to make a choice of WHICH ONE  to enter with!"
"""And to lose to a 'woman', it's unthinkable in his universe.""<br/><br/>Especially since his only idea of a winning woman is a not-yet-dressed Miss Universe."
