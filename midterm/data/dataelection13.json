This is called free market capitalism, and every worker in the US believes in it and hates all forms of bureaucratic regulations. Every business owner or manager tries to maximize profits.

The biggest expense for most businesses is labor. That means you squeeze labor costs to as close to zero as you can. Why would you not move your factory with a labor force that earns $25/hour to another country with a labor force that earns $10/day, no union, no overtime, and no safety regulations? Who cares if you spent 17 years on their factory floor? This is a capitalist enterprise, not your family! The only chance a working man or woman has in this race to the bottom is to be in an industry that cannot cannot export it's labor force, but the trend is moving the other way. Otherwise help can only come from regulation. Mr. Trump has mentioned a couple, and if he is able to upend the wishes of his Republican congress with regulations that protect American jobs, he'll be a real American hero to American workers.
