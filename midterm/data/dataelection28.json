The linked Reuters article from which the inference that \"many\" of \"nearly 100 Chinese dialects\" are spoken by China's 55 recognized ethnic minorities actually states that there are over 100 _languages_ spoken by China's ethnic minorities. Clearly many of these languages, like Tibetan and Uyghur, are not Chinese, while at the same time, many ethnic minorities like the Hui will speak the Chinese dialect or accent of their community or nearby population centers, like Chengdu or Kunming for instance, which would have nothing to do with their ethnicity. Further complicating these distinctions is Cantonese which, when I referred to it once as a \"dialect\" I was sternly corrected by a venerable historical linguist of Chinese who insisted that Cantonese is a language apart from Putonghua. I didn't pursue the issue, but this might also apply to other \"dialects\" like Shanghainese. The article is clearly about Beijing dialect, but the 100 number from the UN seems to be of languages spoken in China, not dialects.<br/><br/>By the way, in addition to the project to save Beijinghua, there has since about 2013 been a great international project of preserving all of China's dialects and languages by recording them and posting the recordings to an online interactive map, a kind of digital oral history of China's languages. <a href=\"http://www.phonemica.net\" title=\"www.phonemica.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.phonemica.net</a>.

Trump isn't draining it but filling it. <br/><br/>Trump told his voters he would change the way the GOP operates, with insiders reaping the benefits and change the way Washington works for the voters. The only thing Trump seems to be changing is cutting out the GOP middleman. Gone will be those who pretend to be part of a political party.

Ellison, Sanders, Warren, Gabbard, Schumer and all the Democrats' job will be to call out Trump and his cronies for every last corrupt deal they'll make.
