Instead, being a true opposition party that sets its own agenda and fights every step of the way is the path to victory. <br/><br/>It is time for the Democrats in the Senate and elsewhere to learn that lesson and flip the script on the GOP.  Do not enable, normalize, or compromise with the phony populist con man who lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes yet will be our next President, and do not compromise with or enable the Koch Brothers' GOP lackeys in the Senate and House. Instead, Democrats must set forth their own populist progressive economic agenda, and fight the coming Republican efforts to privatize Medicare and Social Security, destroy ObamaCare and public education, and line the pockets of billionaires. If Trump or other Republicans want to come across the aisle and support part of our agenda, great. But don't water down our message or normalize the Republicans by constantly chasing compromises with the GOP that always turn out badly for us. <br/><br/>Infrastructure is a case in point. Trump's \"plan\" is simply a corporate tax giveaway to finance toll roads. Democrats must oppose that, and offer actual infrastructure investments instead, rather than trying to tweak Trump's plan to make it slightly less bad.

Instead, it would provide more than $100 billion in corporate tax giveaways in an effort to encourage privately-funded toll roads and bridges.<br/><br/>None of this should come as a surprise from Trump who spent decades outsourcing jobs, fighting unions, and refusing to pay his contractors.
