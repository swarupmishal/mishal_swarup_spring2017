Is the NYT setting its readers up for a shift towards pleasing Trump and his administration? The NYT did not even vet Trump.

But only now is Donald being vetted somewhat but after the fact. We heard more about emails than anything else. And that did as much to suppress Clinton's vote as did Comey and the Russians.  I hear a lot of Trump voters who claim that America has become too soft, too much PC and that they are sick of hearing about safe spaces. So why then are they complaining the loudest when Trump Is bashed and criticized? Not all Trump voters are racist BUT all Trump voters knew that he is.

Whining is the respite of bullies like Trump, and his supporters.  The media distorted its depiction of Clinton's e-mail scandal (sic) in order to keep what looked like a blowout election as close as possible.  Its motive was not political, it was financial.  Keep the race going and the revenues flowing.  That the Times is publishing Spayd's fatuous lament is a case in point of the media's bending over backwards to appear impartial, even when journalistic ethics demand truth before balance.  I recall a front page piece on Ivanka and Donald Trump unveiling their plan for childcare assistance.  They openly lied-- yes lied-- about Clinton's not having a plan and never having even thought of helping working families needing childcare.  The NYT reporting this as \"stretching the truth,\" a phrase that implies there was some truth being stretched.  There was no truth at all to the Trumps' overt and bald faced lies.  There are legion examples of the press doing this.  I'd be happy to discuss this with the Capwells, who shouldn't be exculpated for electing an entirely unqualified and incapable bigot to the presidency.

Regarding the photos, it is a fact that many of us clinch up inside at a mere glimpse, and who doesn't know what he looks like? The image is regularly in our nightmares, and every additional image intensifies our anxiety level. Each article does not need a photo. How about longer, more informative headlines in place of photos of scary old white men? It does seem that sometimes The NY Times tries too hard to put forth right-wing perspectives rather than hard news.
