The family split up on Saturday night, with Mrs. Obama and a friend slipping into ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,'' then congratulating the cast onstage after the curtain went down. A producer, Jeffrey Richards, said Mrs. Obama thanked Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and the other actors for ''blessing my soul'' and added that seeing a production of ''Porgy and Bess'' had been on her ''bucket list.'' Her daughters attended the more family-friendly musical ''Sister Act'' that night, then went backstage to meet the show's 26-year-old star, Raven-Symon\u00e9, according to a production spokesman. On Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Obama and her daughters saw ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.'' A bomb scare, believed to be unrelated to the Obamas' visit, led to the questioning of a theatergoer and a search of his bags by the police and Secret Service agents, a spokesman for the production said; nothing suspicious was found. Mrs. Obama had the prime aisle seat often accorded to celebrities because Spider-Man lands a few feet away during the show; on Sunday Spider-Man (played by Christopher Tierney) dropped down and saluted Mrs. Obama, who laughed and waved, the production spokesman said. Of the three Obama picks, ''Spider-Man'' scored highest at the box office last week, grossing $1.74 million; ''Sister Act'' took in $738,916 and ''Porgy and Bess'' grossed $550,485.
