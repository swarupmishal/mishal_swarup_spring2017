I would just add that it is a massive understatement to simply note that Trump's Attorney General nominee - Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III - has a \"history of racially charged statements.\" <br/><br/>In fact, Sessions, who was named after the President of the Confederacy and a leading Confederate general, is an outright racist who has spent much of his career seeking to suppress voting by African Americans as much as possible. As U.S. Attorney, Sessions twice used bogus charges of voter fraud to unsuccessfully prosecute African Americans for working to register voters in the South. He has dismissed the Voting Rights Act as \"intrusive,\" and celebrated when the Supreme Court significantly weakened it. He has done everything in his power to oppose efforts to end mass incarceration. And on immigration, Sessions not only wants to deport millions of people who have committed the misdemeanor of being in the US without documentation, and he wants to curb even entirely legal immigration. <br/><br/>In short, Sessions would bring to the Attorney General position a disturbing history of racist comments and behaviors that are not the types of characteristics we should want in the nation's top law enforcement officer.
