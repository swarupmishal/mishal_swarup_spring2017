The disconnect between Hillary and millennials was one of luxury. The liberal establishment was founded on intellectualism and a concern for voter issues across backgrounds. Liberal voters, when they vote, consider a range of voting issues. This voting behavior is reflected in the media. While the liberal media picked out trivial problems with Clinton's policy, conservative voters stuck to a single issue and disregarded all  of Trump's other problems. <br/><br/>Millennials have the luxury to consider a broad range of voter issues in their own minds when they go to vote, but what does this mean for a larger voter base that might not have the luxury of intellectualism--and relies on single issues of immigration or jobs to make a decision? This election cycle proved that millennials must not only consider and debate voter issues in their own minds, but should make their political considerations public. This would promote enthusiasm among younger voters. Liberal media should change, and the liberal establishment must respond to these changes. It's time for the Democratic party and commentators to make their arguments more accessible to the public, so that their perception isn't handled or channeled by the intellectual elite. The accessibility was most appealing about Bernie's campaign--and he's right to some extent.

This is patly because the vast majority of the French prefer Jupp\u00e9's vision of French society to Le Pen's.  It is also because the rest of Le Pen's program is anti-Eu and anti-euro, and the French public is attached to the EU and the euro. <br/><br/>But Jupp\u00e9 is not running the typical campaign.  He has said that he will take his election as a mandate for his program, which includes raising the retirement age to 70, a very unpopular measure.  If Le Pen can transform the election into a referendum on his program, if she can convince the electorate that voting for her is a \"no\" vote on Jupp\u00e9's economic program and not a \"yes\" vote for her own,  then she has a good chance of winning.

As time went on and slavery was no longer feasible, the law and the practice morphed, but without acknowledging a grave sin or atoning for it. America is still racist today. America's elite still takes advantage of those it calls its own. With that as the foundation of my comment, here is the rest... Both campaigns used racial divide and conquer tactics, each no less ugly than the other. The media, instead of just reporting the facts, amplified those tactics and aided and abetted the campaigns, deepening the divisions in ways we can't imagine. As Trump is about to take power, who will start putting the genie back in the bottle? Hillary Clinton focused her campaign on white upper middle class female voters, to the exclusion of everyone else. When police brutality hit in September, she went on a Black radio show to announce she maybe will speak to white people. Did she speak to white people by November 8? Nope!<br/><br/>It isn't Trump's rural America that failed Hillary Clinton, but Hillary Clinton's arrogant expectation that not speaking to lower middle class, blue collar, Black, white, Latino, and Asian millennials wouldn't cost her any votes. Cost, it sure did. Voters don't owe candidates a thing. They didn't owe her in 08 or now.<br/><br/>Whites need to join their Black brothers and sisters in the civil rights struggle.
