Little did I know they were actually serious. According to this writer, Romney is to be disqualified simply because of his pre-election disapproval, \"laced with venom\" of Mr. Trump. By this measure there are approximately three people who could be in the general cabinet pool and none of them are Rodolfo Giuliani. One advantage of Romney is that he is a proven negotiator. He is essentially a self made man through his wheeler-dealer days at Bain. No such negotiating experience for Rodolfo. His style has always been the \"my way or the highway\" approach. Romney' skills might best be used in reforming so called Obamacare. If they are really to do the honest thing, they'll say they've done a root and branch overhaul when in reality they simply change the name to Romney-Care. Rodolfo would best if he were put in charge of developing a national policy on the mentally ill who roam our streets. His first hand knowledge of this problem. Anywhere but State would be an improvement. Imagine his first speech to the UN if it resembled his RNC Convention speech at all.

His accomplishments in that office included arranging for sidewalk railings that keep pedestrians from stepping off the curb except in designated places. They also prevent bicycles and cars from driving onto the sidewalk, as is sometimes necessary in an emergency.<br/><br/>Mayor Giuliani's second term was coming to an end, his successor had been elected, and he tried to get others to agree to prolong his term rather than handing over the office to the winner of the election.<br/><br/>When the federal Department of Homeland Security was formed, Mr. Giuliani was asked to recommend someone to be its first leader. The person he recommended, Bernard Kerik, had committed felonies while serving in City government during Giuliani's mayoralty. (Giuliani made his recommendation before the prosecution had begun, but it seems likely he had looked at Kerik's public service closely enough to know about the criminal behavior.) Rather than becoming a Cabinet Secretary, Kerik became a federal inmate.<br/><br/>If these incidents are insufficient to establish that Giuliani is lacking in judgment, we can also look to the instances when he tried to have his mistress attend official events at Gracie Mansion while Giuliani's wife and children were in the residence.

So while I agree that journalists have a duty to verify the stories of those they interview, I don't believe it's fair to require that he verify stories if there is no existing record that these women suffered abuse.  It's important to realize that so many abuse survivors do not have their \"day in court\".  Perhaps they may not have told anyone about the abuse or their circumstances.  They may have told but were not believed.  Regardless, there is plenty of evidence proving that abused children suffer trauma and injury that often impedes their ability to make healthy, \"sane\" decisions.  Those children become adults who make up a huge portion of the prison population.<br/>As I reflect on the comments made by those who insinuate that these women fabricated stories about past abuse, I acknowledge that perhaps these readers don't know anyone who experienced life-altering abuse who didn't receive appropriate help that could have changed the course of their lives.   Perhaps these readers are unaware that they do know abuse survivors.  I wonder what makes these readers so confident that they would make better decisions had they experienced the same level of violence and dysfunction in their formative years that these women claim to have suffered.<br/>Above all, I wonder what makes some people so uncomfortable with a humane corrections system.

At restaurants, where the menus often list most or all of the ingredients, I discreetly reach into my purse for the supplements just before digging into the food, and I avoid certain types of food (e.g., dairy whey additives and seafood that may have been contaminated by scallops) entirely.  I am so grateful that I don't have a possibly deadly peanut allergy or diagnosed celiac disease, but I and others do have to know what is in the foods we consume, because these problems are not just a a conceit for us, but a fact of life.
