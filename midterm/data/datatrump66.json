The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow. IT is much easier to defeat something in New York City than to build something. With that in mind, we should consider whether we want the easy way out or if we can accept a challenge. New Yorkers have been known for their energy, their strength and, especially in the past few years, for their courage. Maybe we're just worn out after pulling together so well after Sept. 11, 2001. It's been a haul. So maybe we just want to sit back and let things take care of themselves -- elsewhere.", "abstract": null, "word_count": 422, "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E0DF1E38F931A25755C0A9639C8B63", "type_of_material": "Op-Ed", "byline": {"original": "By Donald J.
