Consumers are caught in the middle of an arms race between medical providers and insurers in which prices keep going up but in which insurers never pay the list price, only the uninsured and out-of-network do. There is normally a negotiated rate between insurer and provider which is considerably lower than the list price. If we dispensed with this and went to a truth in pricing system, we could make a dent in the problems identified in the article. I normally pay for my providers, as they are usually out of network, and I have never found the doctor's charges to be excessive or unreasonable.

The ER doc was out of network, the blood tests labs were out of network (it was split between 2 different ones!), and the anesthesiologist was out of network.
