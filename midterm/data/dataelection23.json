Believe me. The judiciary would prosecute so if there were any case. This whole nothing burger served to cast aspersions on an honorable person who didn't really use email, but was running for office as a Democrat.  She preferred face-to-face communication and secure diplomatic pouches. Her email account was set up by State IT security experts who visited the basement where the computer was housed. She used her own domain, as she had as a senator. The email address was obviously not one from the State Department. Why did it take four years to notice if any damage could have been done? Classified information varies by government agency, and might be accidentally sent to unclassified servers. Information gets classified retroactively. One is innocent until proven guilty in our system.<br/>Wikipedia has more information as does Political Magazine whose author read the FBI reports. The State rulebook requires three printouts (and filing) of each email received. Rather absurd and dated. The computer system at State was out-dated and staff wasn't always able to print out emails. Secretary Clinton worked from pointed data. With adequate funding (tax money), State IT can be updated and technology from a decade ago used to ensure that emails are backed up incrementally on a nightly basis. No need to print and file each email, which I doubt anyone who needed to function had time to do.
